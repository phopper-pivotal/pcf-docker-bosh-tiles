= Jenkins OSS for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
This repository contains instructions for building a Docker-backed Bosh Managed Jenkins OSS tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (tested with Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime 1.8.4).  

This tile makes use of the official link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/docker-boshrelease[Docker Bosh Release] -- the fastest way to orchestrate Docker containers with persistent data on any infrastructure.

After working through this lab you will have a functioning Docker-backed singlenode Jenkins service managed by Bosh.

== Requirements
. link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/customizing/[Pivotal Ops Manager]
. link:http://bosh.io/docs/bosh-cli.html[BOSH CLI]
. link:http://cf-platform-eng.github.io/isv-portal/tile-generator/[Tile Generator Tools]
. link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/[Docker]

== Install Tile Generator Tools 
. Read through the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Engineering ISV Documentation for custom PCF tile creation: http://cf-platform-eng.github.io/isv-portal/tile-generator/
. Install tile-generator tools according to the documentation: http://cf-platform-eng.github.io/isv-portal/tile-generator/
. Create Ops Manager Metadata for the Pcf utility to make Ops Manager queries on your behalf (only for PCF)
+
----
$ touch metadata
$ echo "---" >> metadata
$ echo "opsmgr:" >> metadata
$ echo "    url: https://opsman.your-company.com" >> metadata
$ echo "    username: webuser" >> metadata
$ echo "    password: webpass" >> metadata
----

. Test your installation of Tile Generator tools. Anywhere the Pcf utility is run the _metadata_ file must exist in working directory:
+
----
$ pcf products
- cf 1.8.4-build.3 (installed)

$ tile
Usage: tile [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

----
$ docker pull jenkins
----

. Create a tile.yml manifest:
